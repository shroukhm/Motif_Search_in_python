# Motif Search Algorithms

Motif search is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics and computational biology. It involves identifying recurring patterns (motifs) within biological sequences such as DNA or protein sequences. This README provides an overview of two common motif search algorithms: Brute Force and Brute Force Median String , implemented in Python from scratch.

## Brute Force Algorithm

The Brute Force motif search algorithm is a straightforward approach that exhaustively searches through all possible substrings of a given length within a sequence. It then compares each substring with a given motif pattern to determine if there is a match. While simple, this algorithm can be computationally expensive, especially for large sequences or motifs.

## Brute Force Median String Search

The Median Brute Force motif search algorithm improves upon the Brute Force approach by reducing the number of comparisons needed. Instead of comparing every substring with the motif pattern, it calculates a median string based on the given sequences. The algorithm then checks if the median string is a valid motif by calculating its Hamming distance with all substrings of the same length in the sequences. The median string with the minimum total Hamming distance is considered the motif.

## Conclusion

Motif search algorithms play a crucial role in various bioinformatics applications, including gene prediction, sequence alignment, and regulatory element identification. While Brute Force offers a simple solution, it may not be efficient for large datasets. The Median Brute Force algorithm provides a more optimized approach by reducing the number of comparisons needed, making it suitable for larger datasets and longer motifs.

Users should choose the appropriate algorithm based on the size of the dataset, the length of the motif, and the available computational resources to efficiently identify motifs within biological sequences.
